# Roblox â€“ But Everyone Can Execute Code
Here you can find example scripts for "Roblox â€“ But Everyone Can Execute Code!"
You're welcome to modify the code and use it for other projects as well.
I hope youâ€™ll learn some programming basics while playing, and most importantly â€” have fun!

If you'd like more permissions in the game, feel free to join our Discord and open a ticket. I can grant you extra rights there.
However, misusing your permissions can result in a kick or ban â€” so please use them responsibly and help make the game enjoyable for others.
(Even if... no one might play it ðŸ˜…)

Also, please note that this game is still in development and will continue to improve over time.
If you like the game, Iâ€™d really appreciate it if you shared it with your friends!

I created this project so people can learn coding in a simple and accessible environment â€” and grow together by experimenting and sharing their knowledge.
